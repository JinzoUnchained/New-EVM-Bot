This bot is gas-optimized to use economy fees, but requires $10 USDC & 0.0015 ETH minimum as a start. 

It works on any EVM network.

Ensure TokenA & TokenB contract addresses are accurate to the network the bot is deployed on.

The bot trades on +/- 0.5% price swings based on Chainlink price feed oracles.

In this stage the bot has no maximum amount of daily trades, so gas should be monitored.
